                    of these complex systems via ‘bottoms up’ approaches is achieved by harnessing the power of modern day 
                    computers to perform state-of-the-art computer simulations based on the principles of equilibrium and 
                    non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The resultant ‘computational microscope’ has enabled the team to

                    denaturation and self-assembly; amyloidogenic pathways and molecular origin of neurodegenerative diseases;

                    Surfaces and interfaces are critical for many important technological applications like solid state 
                    devices (microelectronics, photovoltaic, electrochemical cells, chemical and gas sensors etc.) and catalysis. 
                    Understanding and controlling surface & interface properties thus have a large impact for different applications. 
                    Her research interest focuses primarily on investigating the properties of surfaces and interfaces of 
                    nanomaterials to gain a better understanding of their functionalities.

                    Her group is interested in integrating concepts and skills from chemistry, materials science, 
                    and biology to design nano-structured materials with enhanced functionality for applications in 
                    biomedical implants, cancer diagnostics, and drug delivery. We are particularly focused on seeking a 
                    systematic understanding of the bio-activity of nanostructures and developing specific "structure-bioactivity" 
                    relationships. We believe that such a rational approach is necessary for systematically advancing nano-materials 
                    and biomedical technologies of the future.

                    Dr. Steven P. Gross at University of California Irvine as postdoctoral scholar. In 2008, Dr. Kunwar moved 
                    to University of California Davis to work with Prof. Alex Mogilner as postodoctoral schoal in his computational 
                    biology laboratory. In 2011, Dr. Kunwar moved back to India and joined IIT Gandhinagar as assistant professor 
                    in Physics, In 2012, he moved to IIT Bombay as assistant professor to join Department of Biosciences and 
                    Bioengineering where he is currently working as associate professor. He was awarded “Innovative Young 
                    Biotechnologist Award” of Department of Biotechnology for year 2012 (IYBA 2012). Dr. Kunwar is currently 
                    working on problems such as cargo transport by multiple motor proteins, microtubules and its interaction 
                    with potential anti-cancer drugs.
